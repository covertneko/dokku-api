# dokku-api
Plugin to simplify installation and management of
[dokku-api-server](https://github.com/nikelmwann/dokku-api-server), a REST
service for managing a Dokku host.

##### Disclaimer

This is pretty much just a practice exercise for me. It's not intended to ever be a production ready solution to managing a Dokku host.

Progress will probably be a bit slow since I don't have a ton of free time.
